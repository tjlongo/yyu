# a reference list of categories and tags for organization & classification 
# update & use it to be consistent in picking categories & tags for your posts
# the first level are categories; limit this to a small number (3-9 is ideal)
# subsequent levels are tags, some nested; limit the nesting to 2 levels; any
#   more levels of nesting and tags get too fine-grained; prefer 1st-level tags
# this is an example for a news site; replace it or tailor it to your needs
