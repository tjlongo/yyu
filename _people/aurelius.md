Aurelius Maximus drove a chariot in his young adulthood, but earned his stripes building the Coliseum. Now he's a project manager for Caesar, Caesar, and Hermione, LLC.

### Projects

Aurelius likes to work on construction projects of the grand variety. He's known for getting high production by providing abundant water and gruel to -slaves- workers.
