Terry is a career IT professional with experience as software engineer, instructor, facilitator, consultant, and project manager.  On the side, he developed a keen interest in national politics and especially the nature of political division, which he believes comes about through the accumulation of millions of interpersonal decisions and actions that pit people against each other instead of reconciling differences and solving big problems.
