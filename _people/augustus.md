Augustus Minimus is no small man, by any measure. Tall, wide, long, round, all adjectives that fit. He's a big dude. However, he loves to make mini muffins, you know, those regular muffins that are made too small to be satisfying one at a time? Yeah, he's the master of those.

### Explorations

Augustus loves finding new ingredients for his mini muffins. Chocolate is so old hat, why not licorice pumpernickel tomato basil muffins? Yes, he's made them. What about tuna carpaccio rutabaga walnut? Yes, they've been done. Needless to say, these are not yummy in the conventional sense. Or any sense, really.
