description: >- # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  Yin Yang U's mission is to develop (or curate) and continually improve mental models
  that help individuals and groups master their belief systems through elimination of
  ambiguities and contradictions, so that they can experience and harness accelerated
  cognitive and emotional capabilities demanded by contemporary intra-personal,
  inter-personal and social challenges, all while developing and maintaining respect
  for the depth and richness of others' personal stories and points of view.
